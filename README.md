# WANify_BWA
WANify_BWA is a tool based on top of iPerf 3.0, which measures the static and real-time bandwidths (BWs) for a cluster. The static bandwidth is pair-wise BW measurement between interacting nodes, whereas realtime/dynamic BW is the actual BW when all the interacting nodes are communicating at the same time.
